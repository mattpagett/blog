## Resources

### AI Safety

[BlueDot](https://bluedot.org/) provides education about AI safety and governance.  I completed the AGI Strategy and Technical AI Safety courses in 2025 and recommend them to anyone interested in AI risk.

[ARENA](https://www.arena.education/) - detailed technical AI safety course.  I've formed a self-study group on the ARENA Slack channel. 

### Software Development

[SolveIt](https://newsi.fast.ai/?via_id=oi9lxe79) is a course, a method, and a platform to use LLMs thoughtfully in software development (and other areas, like writing).  It is led by Jeremy Howard whose [Fast.AI course on Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/) remains as relevant and useful as when I first took it in 2019.
